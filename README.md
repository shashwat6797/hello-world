# hello-world
My first repository of github
My name is Shashwat Awasthi and I am just starting to learn how githubn works and how I can use it to learn optimum use of opensource and hopefully make meaningful contributions.
I like to watch movies and opensource is just something that i am really excited about and its a new found interest of mine and I would really love to learn more about the community.
